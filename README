How to Use: On the command line run the executable index.js. It takes 3 arguments, first is the
option you want to run. These options currently are D and E.

D -Runs the program in default mode. (leaving this argument blank will run the program as if a D was entered.)
Two excel files will be compared and a list of differences will be generated.
E -Runs similar to the default option however the program will ignore differences in the keys designated
as non-editable.

The last two arguments are the excel files you wish to compare. If the files you wish to compare are withing the
programs working directory you just need to enter the name of the files. If not you must enter the entire filepath.

Example input:
index.js E Reflist_Sp2019.xlsx Reflist_Fall2019.xlsx

W -Week view and only needs one json file to work correctly. Needs to be a flattened json file.
